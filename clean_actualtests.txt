Answer: B
Explanation:
The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. The organization wants to extend their network into the cloud and
also directly access the internet from their AWS VPC. Thus, the organization should setup a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a private subnet,
and a virtual private gateway to enable communication with their data center network over an IPsec VPN tunnel. To setup this configuration the organization needs
to use the Amazon VPC with a VPN connection. The organization network administrator must designate a physical appliance as a customer gateway and
configure it. The organization would need the below mentioned information to setup this configuration:
The type of customer gateway, such as Cisco ASA, Juniper J-Series, Juniper SSG, Yamaha Internet-routable IP address (static) of the customer gateway's
external interface
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the customer gateway, if the organization is creating a dynamically routed VPN
connection.

An organization is creating a VPC for their application hosting. The organization has created two private subnets in the same AZ and created one subnet in a
separate zone. The organization wants to make a
HA system with the internal ELB. Which of these statements is true with respect to an internal ELB in this scenario?
A. ELB can support only one subnet in each availability zone.
B. ELB does not allow subnet selection; instead it will automatically select all the available subnets of the VPC.
C. If the user is creating an internal ELB, he should use only private subnets.
D. ELB can support all the subnets irrespective of their zone
Answer: A
Explanation:
The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS
resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances.
There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB. For internal servers, such as App sewers the organization can create an internal
load balancer in their VPC and then place back-end application instances behind the internal load balancer. The internal load balancer will route requests to the
back-end application instances, which are also using private IP addresses and only accept requests from the internal load balancer.
The Internal ELB supports only one subnet in each AZ and asks the user to select a subnet while configuring internal ELB.

The MySecureData company has five branches across the globe. They want to expand their data centers such that their web server will be in the AWS and each
branch would have their own database in the local data center. Based on the user login, the company wants to connect to the data center. How can MySecureData
company implement this scenario with the AWS VPC?
A. Create five VPCs with the public subnet for the app server and setup the VPN gateway for each VPN to connect them indMdually.
B. Use the AWS VPN CIoudHub to communicate with multiple VPN connections.
C. Use the AWS CIoudGateway to communicate with multiple VPN connections.
D. It is not possible to connect different data centers from a single VPC.
Answer: B
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the
user wants to connect VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware VPN access to connect with his data
centre. If the organization has multiple VPN connections, he can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CIoudHub.
The VPN CIoudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that the user can use with or without a VPC. This design is suitable for customers with multiple
branch offices and existing internet connections who would like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup
connectMty between remote offices.

Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using AWS Direct Connect?
A. AWS Direct Connect provides users access to public and private resources by using two different connections while maintaining network separation between
the public and private environments.
B. AWS Direct Connect provides a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.
C. AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.
D. AWS Direct Connect reduces your network cost
Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private
connectMty between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth
throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.
By using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection
to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2
instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private
environments.

NEW QUESTION 37
An organization is planning to setup a management network on the AWS VPC. The organization is trying to secure the webserver on a single VPC instance such
that it allows the internet traffic as well as the back-end management traffic. The organization wants to make so that the back end management network
interface can receive the SSH traffic only from a selected IP range, while the internet facing webserver will have an IP address which can receive traffic from all the
internet IPs.
How can the organization achieve this by running web server on a single instance?
A. It is not possible to have two IP addresses for a single instance.
B. The organization should create two network interfaces with the same subnet and security group to assign separate IPs to each network interface.
C. The organization should create two network interfaces with separate subnets so one instance can have two subnets and the respective security groups for
controlled access.
D. The organization should launch an instance with two separate subnets using the same network interface which allows to have a separate CIDR as well as
security groups.
Answer: C
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the
user has defined. An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that the user can attach to an instance in a VPC.
The user can create a management network using two separate network interfaces. For the present scenario it is required that the secondary network interface on
the instance handles the public facing traffic and the primary network interface handles the back-end management traffic and it is connected to a separate subnet
in the VPC that has more restrictive access controls. The public facing interface, which may or may not be behind a load balancer, has an associated security
group to allow access to the server from the internet while the private facing interface has an associated security group allowing SSH access only from an allowed
range of IP addresses either within the VPC or from the internet, a private subnet within the VPC or a virtual private gateway.

Which statement is NOT true about a stack which has been created in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS OpsWorks?
A. Subnets whose instances cannot communicate with the Internet are referred to as public subnets.
B. Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private
subnets.
C. All instances in the stack should have access to any package repositories that your operating system depends on, such as the Amazon Linux or Ubuntu Linux
repositories.
D. Your app and custom cookbook repositories should be accessible for all instances in the stac
Answer: A
Explanation:
In AWS OpsWorks, you can control user access to a stack's instances by creating it in a virtual private cloud (VPC). For example, you might not want users to
have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer.
A VPC consists of one or more subnets, each of which contains one or more instances. Each subnet has an associated routing table that directs outbound traffic
based on its destination IP address.
Instances within a VPC can generally communicate with each other, regardless of their subnet. Subnets whose instances can communicate with the Internet are
referred to as public subnets. Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet
are referred to as private subnets.
AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following
endpoints:
The AWS OpsWorks service, https://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com . Amazon S3
The package repositories for Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, depending on which operating system you specify.
Your app and custom cookbook repositories. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 56
One of the AWS account owners faced a major challenge in June as his account was hacked and the hacker deleted all the data from his AWS account. This
resulted in a major blow to the business.
Which of the below mentioned steps would not have helped in preventing this action?
A. Setup an MFA for each user as well as for the root account user.
B. Take a backup of the critical data to offsite / on premise.
C. Create an AMI and a snapshot of the data at regular intervals as well as keep a copy to separate regions.
D. Do not share the AWS access and secret access keys with others as well do not store it inside programs, instead use IAM roles.
Answer: C
Explanation:
AWS security follows the shared security model where the user is as much responsible as Amazon. If the user wants to have secure access to AWS while hosting
applications on EC2, the first security rule to follow is to enable MFA for all users. This will add an added security layer. In the second step, the user should never
give his access or secret access keys to anyone as well as store inside programs. The
better solution is to use IAM roles. For critical data of the organization, the user should keep an offsite/ in premise backup which will help to recover critical data in
case of security breach.
It is recommended to have AWS AMIs and snapshots as well as keep them at other regions so that they will help in the DR scenario. However, in case of a data
security breach of the account they may not be very helpful as hacker can delete that.
Therefore ,creating an AMI and a snapshot of the data at regular intervals as well as keep a copy to separate regions, would not have helped in preventing this
action.

An organization is setting up a highly scalable application using Elastic Beanstalk. They are using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) as well as a Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC) with public and private subnets. They have the following requirements:
. All the EC2 instances should have a private IP
. All the EC2 instances should receive data via the ELB's. Which of these will not be needed in this setup?
A. Launch the EC2 instances with only the public subnet.
B. Create routing rules which will route all inbound traffic from ELB to the EC2 instances.
C. Configure ELB and NAT as a part of the public subnet only.
D. Create routing rules which will route all outbound traffic from the EC2 instances through NA
Answer: A
Explanation:
The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. If the organization wants the Amazon EC2 instances to have a
private IP address, he should create a public and private subnet for VPC in each Availability Zone (this is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk requirement). The organization
should add their public resources, such as ELB and NAT to the public subnet, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk will assign them unique elastic IP addresses (a static,
public IP address). The organization should launch Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet so that AWS Elastic Beanstalk assigns them non-routable private IP
addresses. Now the organization should configure route tables with the following rules:
. route all inbound traffic from ELB to EC2 instances
. route all outbound traffic from EC2 instances through NAT

B. Keep an application running on premise as well as in AWS with full capacity.
C. Setup a single DB instance which will be accessed by both sites.
D. Setup a weighted DNS service like Route 53 to route traffic across site
Answer: C
Explanation:
AWS has many solutions for DR(Disaster recovery) and HA(High Availability). When the organization wants to have HA and DR with multi-site solution, it should
setup two sites: one on premise and the other on AWS with full capacity. The organization should setup a weighted DNS service which can route traffic to both
sites based on the weightage. When one of the sites fails it can route the entire load to another site. The organization would have minimal RTO in this scenario. If
the organization setups a single DB instance, it will not work well in failover.
Instead they should have two separate DBs in each site and setup data replication based on RTO(recovery time objective )of the organization.

NEW QUESTION 64
Which of the following is true of an instance profile when an IAM role is created using the console?
A. The instance profile uses a different name.
B. The console gives the instance profile the same name as the role it corresponds to.
C. The instance profile should be created manually by a user.
D. The console creates the role and instance profile as separate actions.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon EC2 uses an instance profile as a container for an IAM role. When you create an IAM role using the console, the console creates an instance profile
automatically and gives it the same name as the role it corresponds to. If you use the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK to create a role, you create the role and
instance profile as separate actions, and you might give them different names.

Regarding Identity and Access Management (IAM), Which type of special account belonging to your application allows your code to access Google services
programmatically?
A. Service account
B. Simple Key
C. OAuth
D. Code account
Answer: A
Explanation:
A service account is a special Google account that can be used by applications to access Google
services programmatically. This account belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an indMdual end user. Your application uses the
service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.
A service account can have zero or more pairs of service account keys, which are used to authenticate to Google. A service account key is a public/private keypair
generated by Google. Google retains the public
key, while the user is given the private key.

An organization is setting up RDS for their applications. The organization wants to secure RDS access with VPC. Which of the following options is not required
while designing the RDS with VPC?
A. The organization must create a subnet group with public and private subnet
B. Both the subnets can be in the same or separate AZ.
C. The organization should keep minimum of one IP address in each subnet reserved for RDS failover.
D. If the organization is connecting RDS from the internet it must enable the VPC attributes DNS hostnames and DNS resolution.
E. The organization must create a subnet group with VPC using more than one subnet which are a part of separate AZs.
Answer: A
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual
network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on security
and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that the user can create in a VPC and assign to the RDS DB instances. A
DB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating the DB instances.
Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region. If the RDS instance is required to be accessible from the internet
the organization must enable the VPC attributes, DNS hostnames and DNS resolution. For each RDS DB instance that the user runs in a VPC, he should reserve
at least one address in each subnet in the DB subnet group for use by Amazon RDS for recovery actions.

NEW QUESTION 95
An organization is having a VPC for the HR department, and another VPC for the Admin department. The HR department requires access to all the instances
running in the Admin VPC while the Admin department requires access to all the resources in the HR department. How can the organization setup
this scenario?
A. Setup VPC peering between the VPCs of Admin and HR.
B. Setup ACL with both VPCs which will allow traffic from the CIDR of the other VPC.
C. Setup the security group with each VPC which allows traffic from the CIDR of another VPC.
D. It is not possible to connect resources of one VPC from another VPC.
Answer: A
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the
user has defined. A VPC peering connection allows the user to route traffic between the peer VPCs using private IP addresses as if they are a part of the same
network.
This is helpful when one VPC from the same or different AWS account wants to connect with resources of the other VPC.

ExamKiIIer has created a multi-tenant Learning Management System (LMS). The application is hosted for five different tenants (clients) in the VPCs of the
respective AWS accounts of the tenant. ExamKiIIer wants to setup a centralized server which can connect with the LMS of each tenant upgrade if required.
ExamKiIIer also wants to ensure that one tenant VPC should not be able to connect to the other tenant VPC for security reasons. How can ExamKiI|er setup this
scenario?
A. ExamKiI|er has to setup one centralized VPC which will peer in to all the other VPCs of the tenants.
B. ExamKiI|er should setup VPC peering with all the VPCs peering each other but block the IPs from CIDR of the tenant VPCs to deny them.
C. ExamKiI|er should setup all the VPCs with the same CIDR but have a centralized VP
D. This way only the centralized VPC can talk to the other VPCs using VPC peering.
E. ExamKiI|er should setup all the VPCs meshed together with VPC peering for all VPC
Answer: A
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the
user has defined. A VPC peering connection allows the user to route traffic between the peer VPCs using private IP addresses as if they are a part of the same
network.
This is helpful when one VPC from the same or different AWS account wants to connect with resources of the other VPC. The organization wants to setup that one
VPC can connect with all the other VPCs but all other VPCs cannot connect among each other. This can be achieved by configuring VPC peering where one VPC
is peered with all the other VPCs, but the other VPCs are not peered to each other. The VPCs are in the same or a separate AWS account and should not have
overlapping CIDR blocks.

Answer: C
Explanation:
Task runners call Po||ForTask to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. If tasks are ready in the work queue, PoIIForTask returns a response
immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, PoIIForTask uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to 90 seconds, during which time any
newly scheduled tasks are handed to the task agent. Your remote worker should not call PoIIForTask again on the same worker group until it receives a response,
and this may take up to 90 seconds. Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/APIReference/AP|_Po||ForTask.htmI

NEW QUESTION 111
What is the average queue length recommended by AWS to achieve a lower latency for the 200 PIOPS EBS volume?
A. 5
B. 1
C. 2
D. 4
Answer: B
Explanation:
The queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device. The optimal average queue length will vary for every customer workload, and this value
depends on a particular appIication's sensitMty to IOPS and latency. If the workload is not delivering enough I/O requests to maintain the optimal average queue
length, then the EBS volume might not consistently deliver the IOPS that have been provisioned. However, if the workload maintains an average queue length that
is higher than the optimal value, then the per-request I/O latency will increase; in this case, the user should provision more IOPS for his volume. AWS recommends
that the user should target an optimal average queue length of 1 for every 200 provisioned IOPS and tune that value based on his application requirements.

NEW QUESTION 114
An organization is planning to host a web application in the AWS VPC. The organization does not want to host a database in the public cloud due to statutory
requirements. How can the organization setup in this scenario?
A. The organization should plan the app server on the public subnet and database in the organization’s data center and connect them with the VPN gateway.
B. The organization should plan the app server on the public subnet and use RDS with the private subnet for a secure data operation.
C. The organization should use the public subnet for the app server and use RDS with a storage gateway to access as well as sync the data securely from the
local data center.
D. The organization should plan the app server on the public subnet and database in a private subnet so it will not be in the public cloud.
Answer: A
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account.
The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only
subnet which uses hardware VPN access to
connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all the traffic of the VPN subnet.
If the virtual private gateway is attached with VPC and the user deletes the VPC from the console it will first automatically detach the gateway and only then delete
the VPC.

NEW QUESTION 116
A user is trying to create a PIOPS EBS volume with 4000 IOPS and 100 GB size. AWS does not allow the user to create this volume. What is the possible root
cause for this?
A. PIOPS is supported for EBS higher than 500 GB size
B. The maximum IOPS supported by EBS is 3000
C. The ratio between IOPS and the EBS volume is higher than 30
D. The ratio between IOPS and the EBS volume is lower than 50
Answer: C
Explanation:
A Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volume can range in size from 4 GiB to 16 TiB and you can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to
the volume size requested should be a maximum of 30; for example, a volume with 3000 IOPS must be atleast 100 GB.

NEW QUESTION 127
An organization is setting up a web application with the JEE stack. The application uses the JBoss app server and |V|ySQL DB. The application has a logging
module which logs all the actMties whenever a business function of the JEE application is called. The logging actMty takes some time due to the large size of the
log file. If the application wants to setup a scalable infrastructure which of the below mentioned options will help achieve this setup?
A. Host the log files on EBS with PIOPS which will have higher I/O.
B. Host logging and the app server on separate sewers such that they are both in the same zone.
C. Host logging and the app server on the same instance so that the network latency will be shorter.
D. Create a separate module for logging and using SQS compartmentalize the module such that all calls to logging are asynchronous.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The organization can always launch multiple EC2 instances in the same region across multiple AZs for HA and DR. The AWS architecture practice recommends
compartmentalizing the functionality such that
they can both run in parallel without affecting the performance of the main application. In this scenario logging takes a longer time due to the large size of the log
file. Thus, it is recommended that the organization should separate them out and make separate modules and make asynchronous calls among them. This way the
application can scale as per the requirement and the performance will not bear the impact of logging.

A user is hosting a public website on AWS. The user wants to have the database and the app server on the AWS VPC. The user wants to setup a database that
can connect to the Internet for any patch upgrade but cannot receive any request from the internet. How can the user set this up?
A. Setup DB in a private subnet with the security group allowing only outbound traffic.
B. Setup DB in a public subnet with the security group allowing only inbound data.
C. Setup DB in a local data center and use a private gateway to connect the application with DB.
D. Setup DB in a private subnet which is connected to the internet via NAT for outbound.
Answer: D
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the
user has defined. AWS provides two features that the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network ACLs. When the user wants to setup
both the DB and App on VPC, the user should make one public and one private subnet. The DB should be hosted in a private subnet and instances in that subnet
cannot reach the internet. The user can allow an instance in his VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections
from the internet by using a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance.

required in this scenario?
A. The organization must enable the parameter in the console which makes the RDS instance publicly accessible.
B. The organization must allow access from the internet in the RDS VPC security group,
C. The organization must setup RDS with the subnet group which has an external IP.
D. The organization must enable the VPC attributes DNS hostnames and DNS resolutio
Answer: C
Explanation:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual
network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on security
and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that the user can create in a VPC and which the user assigns to the RDS
DB instances. A DB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating DB instances. If the RDS instance is required to be accessible from
the internet:
The organization must setup that the RDS instance is enabled with the VPC attributes, DNS hostnames and DNS resolution.
The organization must enable the parameter in the console which makes the RDS instance publicly accessible.
The organization must allow access from the internet in the RDS VPC security group. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 236
You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call actMty of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes
timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls. Usually there are
a few calls/second, but once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be
avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project.
What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?
A. Use DynamoDB with a "CaIIs" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "State" attribute that can equal to "active" or "terminated". In this way the Global
Secondary Index can be used for all items in the table.
B. Use RDS Multi-AZ with a "CALLS" table and an indexed "STATE" field that can be equal to "ACT|VE"or 'TERMINATED". In this way the SQL query is optimized
by the use of the Index.
C. Use RDS Nlulti-AZ with two tables, one for "ACT|VE_CALLS" and one for "TERMINATED_CALLS". In this way the "ACTIVE_CALLS" table is always small and
effective to access.
D. Use DynamoDB with a "CaIIs" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "Is Active" attribute that is present for active calls onl
E. In this way the Global Secondary Index is sparse and more effective.

NEW QUESTION 288
You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps
throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000
IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read
and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you
add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 |OPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000
IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the
instance level does not increase at all.
What is the problem and a valid solution?
A. The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBSOptimized instance that provides larger throughput.
B. Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device driver and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to
increase throughput.
C. The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also be a 500GB 4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume.
D. Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB.
E. RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices; use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes, but increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6,000
IOPS.
